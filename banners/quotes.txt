Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide, is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. [Edward Snowden]
Privacy isn’t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. And that’s who you are. That’s what you believe in. That’s who you want to become. Privacy is the right to the self. Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms. [Edward Snowden]
No system of mass surveillance has existed in any society, that we know of to this point, that has not been abused. [Edward Snowden]
